    <h1>Welcome to my Introduction to HTML5 Basics</h1>
    <p>HTML5 introduces many new features and capabilities compared to its predecessors.</p>

    <h2>Unordered List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Form Enhancements: HTML5 introduced smarter input types like type="email", type="date", and type="number". These automatically trigger mobile keyboards with the correct layout (like showing a "@" symbol or a number pad) and handle basic validation without needing complex JavaScript</li>
        <li>Local Storage: Before HTML5, websites relied heavily on cookies, which are small and sent with every server request. HTML5 introduced localStorage and sessionStorage, allowing websites to store larger amounts of data directly in your browser securely and efficiently.</li>
        <li>The Content Model: In HTML5, the way elements can be nested is more flexible but strictly defined by "categories" (like Metadata, Flow, Sectioning, and Phrasing). This ensures that the document remains "accessible," meaning screen readers for the visually impaired can navigate the site logically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ordered List</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Document Object Model (DOM): The hierarchical structure that represents your page as a tree of objects, allowing languages like JavaScript to interact with your HTML.</li>
        <li>Local Storage: A modern way for websites to store data directly in the user's browser, making sites faster and more capable of working offline.</li>
        <li>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): HTML5 allows you to embed SVG code directly. Unlike standard images, SVGs never get "blurry" or pixelated when you zoom in, which is perfect for icons and logos.</li>
    </ol>
